export OMP_NUM_THREADS = 4 // number of threads in execution = 4
./hello.exe  % to run the code

omp_set_num_threads(int num_threads) % number of threads to be created for parallel region
omp_get_num_threads() % number of threads currently executing the parallel region
omp_get_max_threads() % max number of threads that can be allocated
omp_get_thread_num() % thread number of the calling thread in currently executing region
omp_get_num_procs() % number of processors available
omp_get_wtime % gets the wall clock
omp_get_wtick % resolution of timer in seconds
